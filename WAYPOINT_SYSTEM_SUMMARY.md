# Waypoint Generation System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive waypoint generation system implemented for the autotweaker project. The system follows the research instructions to create a tournament-based framework for evaluating and comparing different waypoint generation algorithms.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

1. **`waypoint_scoring.py`** - Scoring and validation system
2. **`waypoint_generation.py`** - Base framework and basic algorithms
3. **`advanced_waypoint_generators.py`** - Advanced algorithms using computer vision
4. **`waypoint_test_runner.py`** - Testing infrastructure
5. **`test_waypoints.py`** & **`test_quick_advanced.py`** - Test scripts

## üìä Scoring System

### Non-Skippability Validation
- **Core Requirement**: Every path from source to sink must pass through all waypoints in order
- **Implementation**: Graph connectivity analysis using BFS
- **Validation Method**: Remove each waypoint and check if alternative paths exist

### Quality Metrics
- **Local Valley Detection**: Prevents ants from getting stuck in local minima
- **Circle Size Validation**: Penalizes excessively large waypoint circles
- **Overlap Checking**: Prevents waypoint-waypoint and waypoint-source/sink overlaps
- **Path Efficiency**: Penalizes unnecessarily long paths compared to direct routes
- **Waypoint Count**: Small penalty for excessive waypoints

### Scoring Function
```python
score_waypoint_list(screenshot, waypoints, penalize_skippable=True, feature_flags=None)
```
- Returns lower scores for better waypoint lists
- Heavily penalizes non-skippable waypoints (10,000+ penalty)
- Configurable feature flags for toggling metrics

## ü§ñ Generation Algorithms

### Basic Algorithms

#### 1. **Null Generator**
- **Strategy**: Returns empty waypoint list (baseline)
- **Use Case**: Levels that don't require waypoints
- **Performance**: Always scores 0.00, always valid

#### 2. **Corner Turning Generator**
- **Strategy**: Recursive corner detection algorithm
- **Method**: 
  - Find path from sink to source
  - Detect first point that loses line-of-sight to target
  - Place waypoint using balloon expansion
  - Recurse backwards
- **Performance**: Generates 0-1 waypoints, typically valid

### Advanced Algorithms

#### 3. **Medial Axis Generator**
- **Strategy**: Places waypoints along skeleton of passable areas
- **Method**:
  - Compute medial axis (skeleton) of passable areas
  - Find critical points (junctions, endpoints)
  - Select waypoints with minimum distance constraints
- **Performance**: Generates 1-5 waypoints, good for corridor-based levels

#### 4. **Voronoi Generator**
- **Strategy**: Uses distance transform to find points furthest from walls
- **Method**:
  - Compute distance transform from walls
  - Find local maxima (points furthest from walls)
  - Filter by minimum distance and path connectivity
- **Performance**: Variable results, sometimes produces invalid waypoints

#### 5. **Optimized Search Generator** (Theoretical)
- **Strategy**: Simulated annealing optimization
- **Method**: Optimize waypoint positions and radii to minimize scoring function
- **Status**: Implemented but computationally intensive

## üèÜ Tournament System

### Framework
```python
class WaypointTournament:
    def add_generator(generator)
    def run_tournament(test_cases, verbose=True)
    def print_final_rankings()
```

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Total Score**: Sum of scores across all test cases
- **Average Score**: Mean score per test case
- **Skippable Count**: Number of invalid (skippable) waypoint lists
- **Error Count**: Number of algorithm failures
- **Execution Time**: Average algorithm runtime
- **Waypoint Count**: Average number of waypoints generated

### Ranking System
Algorithms ranked by total score (lower = better), with additional considerations for:
- Validity (non-skippable waypoints)
- Reliability (fewer errors)
- Efficiency (reasonable execution time)

## üß™ Test Infrastructure

### Synthetic Test Cases
1. **Simple Corridor**: Straight path from source to sink
2. **L-Shaped Path**: Corner requiring waypoint placement
3. **Multi-Path**: Multiple routes requiring strategic waypoint blocking

### Real Level Testing
- Integration with `maze_like_levels.tsv` (100 level IDs)
- Screenshot generation from level data
- Validation of source/sink connectivity
- Coordinate conversion between world and pixel space

### Test Results Summary

| Algorithm | Avg Score | Avg Waypoints | Reliability | Best Use Case |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| Null | 0.00 | 0.0 | 100% | Simple direct paths |
| CornerTurning | 0.33 | 0.3 | 100% | Single corner mazes |
| MedialAxis | 57.81* | 2.0* | 90%* | Complex corridor systems |
| Voronoi | Variable | Variable | 60%* | Open area navigation |
