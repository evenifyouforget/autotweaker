# This section contains global Mypy settings.

# Ignore missing imports: Prevents errors for modules Mypy can't find type information for.
# This is crucial for older codebases or third-party libraries without type stubs.
ignore_missing_imports = True

# Allow untyped definitions: Prevents errors for functions that do not have type annotations.
# Useful for gradually adding types to an existing codebase.
allow_untyped_defs = True

# No strict optional: Relaxes checks related to `None`.
# Allows `None` to be assigned to variables of type `T` without explicitly using `Optional[T]`.
no_strict_optional = True

# You can add more Mypy options here as your codebase becomes more typed.
# For example, to enable more strictness later:
# disallow_untyped_calls = True
# warn_unused_ignores = True

# You can also configure specific modules or packages differently:
# [mypy-your_module.sub_module.*]
# disallow_untyped_defs = False
